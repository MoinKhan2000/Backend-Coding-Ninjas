// TODO - Disadvantages Of The MVC Architecture.
/*
    1. Tight Coupling.
    2. Complexity as application grows.
    3. Difficult to maintain and difficult to make changes.
    4. Difficult to extend or scale up.
    5. Difficult to reuse.
*/

// TODO - Advantages Of The API Pattern.
/*
    1. Loose Coupling.
    2. Reusability: APIs can be reused across different parts of the application and even in other applications.
    3. Scalability: Easier to scale individual services without affecting the entire system.
    4. Flexibility: APIs can be consumed by different types of clients (e.g., web, mobile).
    5. Security: Allows for better security practices by exposing only specific endpoints.
    6. Versioning: Different versions of APIs can coexist, allowing for backward compatibility.

// TODO - Types Of API.
/*
    1. SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol. (Heavy due to envelope, uses XML, more secure and suitable for enterprise applications)
    2. REST:API - Representational State Transfer. (Lightweight, high performance, uses standard HTTP methods, stateless, and suitable for web services)
    3. GraphQL - A query language for APIs. (Flexible and efficient, allows clients to request only the data they need, reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data)
    4. gRPC - Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework. (Efficient, uses protocol buffers for serialization, supports multiple languages, and suitable for microservices)
    5. WebSocket - Provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. (Suitable for real-time applications such as chat apps and live updates)
