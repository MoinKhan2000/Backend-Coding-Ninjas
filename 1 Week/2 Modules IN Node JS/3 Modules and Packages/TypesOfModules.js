// 1. **User Defined Modules / Internal Modules**: These modules are defined and used by the user (developer). They are created within the project and are not part of the Node.js core modules. User-defined modules are imported and exported by the developer as needed to organize and modularize their codebase effectively.

// 2. **Core Modules**: Core modules are modules provided by Node.js itself. They are built-in modules that come pre-installed with Node.js and do not require installation through npm. These modules provide essential functionality for various tasks such as file system operations, networking, and utilities. Examples of core modules include `fs`, `http`, `path`, and `util`.

// 3. **External Modules**: These modules are used by the user (developer). They are created in the project and are not part of the Node.js core modules. User-defined modules are imported and exported by the developer as needed to organize and modularize their codebase effectively.
