## Why Mongoose?

Mongoose is an essential tool in the development of this project for several reasons:

### 1. Object Data Modeling (ODM)
Mongoose acts as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing a structured way to interact with the database. It allows you to define schemas for your collections, ensuring that your data is well-organized and consistent. This structure simplifies data management and enhances code readability, particularly when dealing with complex data models.

### 2. Better Structure
By enforcing a schema-based structure, Mongoose ensures that all documents within a collection adhere to a predefined format. This reduces the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies, making the database more reliable. The enforced structure also contributes to maintaining a cleaner and more organized codebase.

### 3. Validations
Mongoose offers built-in validation mechanisms that help maintain data integrity. You can define various validation rules directly within your schema, such as required fields, specific data types, and custom validation logic. These validations prevent invalid data from being saved to the database, which is crucial for maintaining high data quality.

### 4. More Control Using Middlewares
Mongoose supports middleware functions, providing you with greater control over the document lifecycle. Middlewares can be executed at different stages, such as before saving, updating, or deleting a document. This allows you to implement custom logic, enforce additional validations, manage audit trails, or trigger additional operations as needed. 

### 5. Rich API
Mongoose comes with a rich API that offers a wide range of features, such as query building, population (which allows referencing documents in other collections), and utilities for data aggregation. This comprehensive set of tools enables developers to perform complex database operations with ease and flexibility, improving productivity and efficiency.
